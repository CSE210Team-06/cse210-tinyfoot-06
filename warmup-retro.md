**Stephen Taylor**

Went Well: really appreciated how other team members made themselves avaible to help

Needs Improvement: More clear division of roles

Strengths: Helped keep meetings focused. Did some planning. Developed some practices on how code should be writtent and reviewed.

Weaknesses: I was unable to contribute as much as I would like in terms of technical development.

**Vincent Thai**

Went Well: Everyone was pretty responsive, and on top of messages

Needs Improvement:Get closer as a team, more in-person stuff

Strengths: I was good at responding to messages and being available. I was also able to help out others when needed.

Weaknesses: I could use more technical knowledge. I could also be more proactive about keeping up with other teams as I wasn't knowledgable about what they were doing.

**Ethan Lee**

Went Well: We had a well-planned schedule, and stuck with it

Needs Improvement:Wanted to use this assigment to get a broader view of software eng., wasn't keeping each other in the loop about what each sub-group was doing
-Suggestion: Provide a summary about what you did, so everyone can be on the same page

Strengths: I used this software engineering assignment as an opportunity to learn more about things I did not know well. For instance, I shadowed a meeting with team members that were discussing implementing basic CI/CD pipelines.

Weaknesses: I was not on top of communications and definitely wish I tried writing more challenging source code.

**Sahil Deshmukh**

Went Well: Everyone volunteered, no one had to be delegated anything

Needs Improvement:Should have been more collaboration between teams, should have been more reguler check-ins across teams

Strengths: I actively participated in all team tasks and excelled at finding solutions to both technical and managerial challenges that our team encountered.

Weaknesses: I sometimes struggled with punctuality for meetings and was occasionally slow in communicating with my team members.

**Gagan Mundada**

Went Well: Everyone made themselves availble when you needed them

Needs Improvement:Would prefer to see more in-person meetings

**U Lam Lou**

Went Well: Teammates were helpful about explaining technical details

Needs Improvement:More fixed times for meetings instead of floating meetings scheduled last minute

Strengths: I am proactive in asking for help or clarification and finding online resources to understand some concepts or codes (for example, CSS and some Javascript code in this assignment) when I am confused or have no prior knowledge of that coding language. I am also good at designing webpages when using CSS.

Weaknesses: My limited programming background currently makes it harder for me to contribute to my team at the level Iâ€™d like, which makes me less efficient than my teammates.
-How to improve: Follow more practices in Leetcode and try to read resources that can help build a more solid foundation in SE.

**Sushaanth Srinivasan**

Went Well: Everyone on the team was enthusiastic and enterprising. No one had to be reminded to do their part, and everyone was very proactive.

Needs Improvement: Need to have some more online/offline cross sub-team meetings to discuss about each others' work and learn in the process.

Strengths: First time managing a large team, learnt a lot about how our team works in this process. Learnt to create CI/CD pipelines as I only knew the concept before. Also due to merging so many branches with many changes, I am now quite comfortable with merging and resolving merge conflicts.

Weaknesses: Felt like I was not able to implement quality code due to the complexities involved and the project time frame.

**Nishant**

Went Well: I think the co-ordination and delegation of work between different team mebers was excellent. I did feel that we really wqorked as a team to get the job done.

Needs Improvement:
Actual developmental practisces need to be improved. the ability to delievr code of the utmost quality under restictred time limites is a skll we have to master and we will endeavor to do it in this course.

**Vedant**

Went Well:

Needs Improvement:

## Plan to improve

Need to settle on a regular in-person meeting time.
-Thursdays after class. First meeting at Mission Brewery
-First meeting will be hammering out details of code development process
-How and when code reivews are done
-Syntax conventions
-How sub-teams update each other
-etc.
