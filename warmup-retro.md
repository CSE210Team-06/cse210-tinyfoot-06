**Stephen Taylor**

Went Well: really appreciated how other team members made themselves avaible to help

Needs Improvement: More clear division of roles

Strengths: Helped keep meetings focused. Did some planning. Developed some practices on how code should be writtent and reviewed.

Weaknesses: I was unable to contribute as much as I would like in terms of technical development.

**Vincent Thai**

Went Well: Everyone was pretty responsive, and on top of messages

Needs Improvement:Get closer as a team, more in-person stuff

Strengths: I was good at responding to messages and being available. I was also able to help out others when needed.

Weaknesses: I could use more technical knowledge. I could also be more proactive about keeping up with other teams as I wasn't knowledgable about what they were doing.

**Ethan Lee**

Went Well: We had a well-planned schedule, and stuck with it

Needs Improvement:Wanted to use this assigment to get a broader view of software eng., wasn't keeping each other in the loop about what each sub-group was doing
-Suggestion: Provide a summary about what you did, so everyone can be on the same page

Strengths: I used this software engineering assignment as an opportunity to learn more about things I did not know well. For instance, I shadowed a meeting with team members that were discussing implementing basic CI/CD pipelines.

Weaknesses: I was not on top of communications and definitely wish I tried writing more challenging source code.

**Sahil Deshmukh**

Went Well: Everyone volunteered, no one had to be delegated anything

Needs Improvement:Should have been more collaboration between teams, should have been more reguler check-ins across teams

**Gagan Mundada**

Went Well: Everyone made themselves availble when you needed them

Needs Improvement:Would prefer to see more in-person meetings

**U Lam Lou**

Went Well: Teammates were helpful about explaining technical details

Needs Improvement:More fixed times for meetings instead of floating meetings scheduled last minute
