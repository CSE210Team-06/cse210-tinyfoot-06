# 1. Functionality - Gagan
The file follows a typical HTML5 structure, including responsive viewport settings and basic metadata. It links to a CSS file, bigfoot-default.css, which styles the footnotes on the page. The main content of the page is made up of regular paragraphs and headings, and whenever there’s a footnote, it’s marked in the text using a superscript. This superscript element is given a unique ID and links to the corresponding footnote.
At the bottom of the page, you’ll find a section dedicated to the footnotes. They’re displayed as an ordered list inside a <div> with the class footnotes. Each item in this list contains the actual content of the footnote, and the superscripts in the text link back to these footnotes, making it easy for users to jump to the right spot.
There are three important script elements included at the end of the body to make this footnote system interactive:
jQuery (version 1.8.3) – the JavaScript library Bigfoot.js relies on.
The Bigfoot.js script – the core library that powers the footnote functionality.
An inline script – which initializes Bigfoot.js as soon as the document is ready to ensure the footnotes are interactive.
Once the page is loaded, Bigfoot.js works behind the scenes to transform the static HTML footnotes into a more dynamic, pop-up style. This gives users a much more interactive and visually appealing experience without messing with the page’s logical structure.
The footnotes have two main visual elements: the footnote button and the footnote content. Let’s break them down:
Footnote button (.bigfoot-footnote__button): This button appears in the text where a footnote is referenced. It’s designed to be both subtle and noticeable. By default, it has a light gray background, rounded corners, and sits slightly above the text line. It’s not flashy, but it becomes more noticeable when you hover over it or focus on it. At that point, the background darkens a little to give users clear feedback. The color change is smooth, which makes the interaction feel natural and polished.
Footnote content (.bigfoot-footnote): When you click on the footnote button, the content of the footnote pops up with a sleek animation. It starts off very small and invisible, then grows in size and fades in smoothly. The footnote itself is shown in a clean, white container that stands out against the rest of the page, making it easy to read without distracting from the main text.
Bigfoot.js is a jQuery plugin that extends jQuery's functionality, requiring jQuery to operate. While the package.json does not specify exact version requirements, it is likely compatible with jQuery versions available at the time of its last update, specifically around version 2.1. The plugin utilizes Grunt (version 0.4.1) as its task runner for building and processing files. It is written in CoffeeScript , which is then compiled to JavaScript. For styling, it employs Sass, allowing for customized styling options. 

# 2. Readability and Maintainability -Vincent
Readability mainly concerns the bigfoot.coffee file. This is the single file where all source code is written in. The code is easy to read and is properly indented with consistent naming conventions. Variable and method names are descriptive and there is no ambiguity about their meanings or purposes. 

Javadoc-style comments are written above every function and are immensely helpful for understanding them. They are thorough in explaining function parameters, return values, access levels, and side effects. 

Comments within the functions are abundant and are used to explain the purpose of a code block, give background information about a programming decision, or give additional information about how the code works. They add additional information not included in the Javadoc-style comments and are extremely useful.

Overall, the code’s syntactical quality is superb and the developer makes excellent use of comments to explain and elaborate on the code. It is very easy to follow the developer’s thought process and gain a strong understanding of how the library works.

However, the library is not easily maintainable, despite the code’s readability. 

The developer leaves little to no information about the structure of the coffee file itself, which makes it difficult to locate functions for particular tasks, like getters, setters, or event handlers. The developer appears to consciously group functions of similar behaviors together. For instance, event handlers are stored in a group starting around line 556. A commonly-repeated ASCII art comment is the only possible indication of separation between these groups of functions.

Also, there is a severe lack of documentation about the structure of the repository itself. Whereas the coffescript source code was well documented and explained, there is little to no information about the structure of the repository, as well as why it is structured that way and how changing that structure may impact the library. This can become a major obstacle to future developers looking to refactor and update the library.

# 3. Code Structure and Design - Sahil
Bigfoot.js utilizes CoffeeScript and Sass for its core implementation. It has a task-runner based workflow which is managed by Grunt (version 0.4.5). It is then compiled to JavaScript. For Styling Sass is used for modular CSS. It uses grunt-contrib-concat for concatenation and grunt-contrib-uglify for the purpose of minification. It uses grunt-autoprefixer for cross browser compatibility. It also automatically rebuilds using the watch task (grunt-contrib-watch). 

It uses a jQuery based plugin architecture. The logic is implemented as a method added to jQuery’s prototype allowing it to be called on jQuery objects.The customization plugins are merged with default settings using jQuery's extend method. The build process is managed by Grunt which ensures the build version in coffee and sass is properly compiled. 

The code follows established design patterns and architectural guidelines. It uses the jQuery plugin pattern. It has a  modular structure, separation of concerns between logic and styling, and uses a task runner for build processes. Bigfoot.js maintains reasonable function and class sizes. 

It uses CoffeeScript and modular CSS suggesting that the code is broken into manageable and focused components. It has smaller and more maintainable functions and classes. 

The code also adheres to the principles of separation of concerns and single responsibility. It uses separate files for JavaScript and CSS i.e. CoffeeScript and Sass. The modular structure and task-based build process suggest that different aspects of functionality are likely separated into distinct components, each with a specific responsibility.

# 4. Performance and Efficiency -Vincent
Bigfoot is a lightweight library and its performance impact on browsers is minor. This was true for its time and is even truer today as devices become stronger. The code itself is well-written and contains no glaring efficiency issues. The developer makes minimal use of loops; the only loop written by the developer is used to fill in reference attributes with the correct value. This loop grows linearly in time with respect to the number of strings to perform replacements on, as the regex pattern consists only of simple strings (“BUTTON”, “SUP”) to match. 
The developer also makes effective use of filters and jQuery getter functions to efficiently retrieve and process footnote information. Memory is managed well through functions that clean up the Document Object Model and remove redundant footnote objects. These good memory practices ensure Bigfoot is scalable and can handle large amounts of footnotes efficiently. 
Bigfoot is a product of its time and makes heavy use of jQuery when it was still in vogue. jQuery is an effective tool but its use does come with some performance overhead, as Javascript has since introduced more efficient, built-in features and operation. Newer versions of JavaScript have incorporated features formerly exclusive to jQuery, which means this library can be made more efficient through refactoring.

# 5. Error Handling and Logging - Sahil

The project uses older versions of development tools and libraries which does not include error handling mechanisms. There are no exception frameworks or error logging libraries. Although CoffeeScript has its own syntax for try/catch blocks and error management it is not used here. The project uses Grunt for task running, which typically outputs build information to the console, but this is not the same as application-level logging. CoffeeScript, which is used in this project, has built-in console.log functionality that could be used for basic logging and debugging. Also it does not have testing frameworks in the dependencies which suggests that it does not include a comprehensive testing and debugging setup.

# 6. Security - Gagan
The Bigfoot jQuery plugin has a little security impact because it is primarily used to improve footnote functionality rather than manage sensitive data. It does, however, include certain security features, such as cleaning user input to lessen the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. It inserts material using jQuery's `html()` technique, which could be dangerous if not used correctly. Features like CSRF protection are unnecessary because it is only a front-end tool and does not handle sensitive data or authentication. To preserve security, it's crucial to examine and update the code.

# 7. Test Coverage (Steve)
The code base includes no tests. You can see the results of this practice within the github issues. This makes it difficult to trust this tool as there is essentially no verification of it’s functionality.




# 8. Code Reuse and Dependencies (Steve)
While jQuery might not be standard now, it was quite common during the time period when Bigfoot was in active use. The tool works quite well once you rewind to the standards of 8-10 years ago

# 9. Compliance with Coding Standards (Steve)
Incompatible with jQuery 3.0+
N/A

# 10. Documentation (Steve)
High level documentation
Changelog only goes back to version 2.0. 

There is a readme and a readme-dev.md. The readme-dev.md is sparse and lacks context (I’m assuming it’s for developers). At this point the information within the document is so sparse I don’t see the point in it. Well the readme is clear about Bigfoot’s intended purpose it is not particularly well organized. Could this be explained by markdown not having the same functionality 8 years ago as it does now? I would prefer to see important sub-sections like Requirements as a heading. And for there to be an equivalent to a Hello World section, with a simple example html file (could be the one from the project page!) that a user can host and play around with so they can see how it works.

I have not seen a high level document explaining the repo structure or what each file does. I see this as a pretty huge failing.

Code documentation
Bigfoot
The gruntfile.coffee file does not provide any comments, nor does the bower.json. While I have seen this many times in .jsons I am unfamiliar with .coffee files, but it seems like it’s javaScript-adjacent. This would imply it should be more thoroughly documented. 

Src
The documentation does not specify what this folder or it’s sub-folders are for. Bigfoot.coffee has useful function documentation. As do the .scss files.

Dist
No file appears to have any comment documentation at all. Even the Bigfoot.js where most of the logic appears to be limited.

Overall, the in-code documentation and code structure documentation are lacking.

Project Page
The project page is well-laid out and clear. I thought the demo was a helpful visual tool for clarifying what Bigfoot has to offer and what it should look like. The usage section was not all that helpful to me, especially without a hello world example. I appreciated the thorough options section though.
We need Saas and Ruby for running the Grunt files from the repo.

# If we would use it

Well Bigfoot is a very functional library, we would not use it now in 2024. There isn't enough documentation and support to use this tool almost 10 years in the future. jQuery and Gimp are older dependencies that aren't commmon practice anymore, and while this issue on it's own wouldn't be insurmountable, the documentation is to poor to make overcoming this worth it.

If this were 2015, when Github issues were being actively resolved, and the coding practices were up to date for the time we would have used this tool.

There are three steps to making this tool useful: (1) Replacing Gimp (2) Replacing jQuery (3) A detailed code documentation

The first 2 tasks are a relatively light lift (updating gimp was our change to the tool), but a detailed code documentation could take days of work.
