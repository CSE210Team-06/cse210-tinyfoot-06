Meeting Notes 10/14:

Finish markdown files, keep length to 5 pages or under
Create 3 repositories for Bigfoot, Littlefoot, Tinyfoot respectively
Bigfoot is lightweight library, works mainly via jQuery and Grunt
Littlefoot doesn't use jQuery, uses typescript instead of coffeescript (file mainly used for settings), dom folder contains many ts files for different tasks and components. Lots more dependencies.
Start Tinyfoot a. Start creating repo with starting files and folders b. Everybody should clone their own version, create dev branch, use pull requests/issues to develop and assign issues c. Go for simpler approach using jQuery to add a side panel. 1 team can create, 1 can style, 1 can document, 1 can integrate tests. Teams of 2 each.
